# javascript-2-ca

## This is a school project for Noroff Students

## Goal
To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front-end functionality for a social media application.

## API
The API you are using for this project can be found under Social EndPoints in the Noroff API documentation.

## Brief
You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.

User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile

## Trello Board

There were very vague instructions on how to use Trello for this project, so I just made a board and added the tasks I thought I needed to do. I didn't use it much after that.
It was stated that you MAY use Trello or GitHub Projects, I chose Trello for this project with my free account (free trial used and expired).
As I worked alone on this project I had little need for a project management tool, but as it MAY have been intended as a requirement and for learning purposes I made a Trello board.
